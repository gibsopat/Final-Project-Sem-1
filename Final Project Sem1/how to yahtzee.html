    <h1>An Unnamed Dice Game</h1>
    <p class = "rules">A game of chance that can still be plenty of fun.</p>
    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <p class = "rules">The game naturally counts the total of each player's dice to see who wins, but feel free to modify this to add more strategy to the game. For example, you can give each player up to three additional die rolls of individual dice. This will allow players to decide which of there dice are worth rolling and which are too risky, adding risk and reward to the game.</p>
    <h2>Game Settings</h2>
    <p class = "rules">In the menu tab for An Unnamed Dice Game, you can find a settings option that allows you to change what kind of dice players are using. This can add more variation to the game. Another option is to use this after already taking the initial roll, so that one die is with more than the rest. You could then add this rule to the gamemode explained early, which could be lead to fun new possibilities.</p>
